# Web Traffic Time Serie Forecasting
This folder contains the final project for the **Statistical Machine Learning course**. 

It is based on the Kaggle competition [Web Traffic Time Serie Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting), that requires to forecast the future values of multiple time series. 

The data consists of approximately 145,000 Wikipedia articles and they can be found in the data folder. 

## Approches 
We compared three different approches to solve this problem: 
* ARIMA model
* LSTM
* Wavenet
